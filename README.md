# Full React tutorial

Hi, my name is **Louis Duong**! I am currently following the **freeCodeCamp.org** React tutorial.  
You can watch the video [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4rFhThSX04).

This is a **15-hour course** about React, and I am actively taking **notes** while learning.  

The notes are organized into **6 chapters plus 1 bonus section**, making it easier to follow along and review later.  

The video also includes some **challenges**, all of which can be found in this repository.  

All the challenges are my version the best for you it is to redo it by yourself. I didn't copy past what you can find in the video.
